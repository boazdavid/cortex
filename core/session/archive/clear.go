// would then write a second event 1 into the same directory, the collision SeqSeeder exists to
// prevent. So a re-created session carries on its old numbering, which is harmless: a seq is
// unique within a session, never dense. Only once the clear has succeeded does the writer forget
// the numbering of every id that recorded nothing since, so a session started under one of those
// later numbers from 1.
