// server no request goes to, and S would write a route that does not happen. servers.Inactive
// decides it, as it does for `agentop server`, and words it the same way.
//
// Decoded leniently, as `agentop server`'s listing reads the file: the proxy validated this
// config before it ran it. But a config that does not decode at all is not on — a column read
// off half of one would name servers that were never read — and that is the one reason here no
